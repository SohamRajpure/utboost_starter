  "file_level_analysis": "Based on the issue description and the existing test patch provided, I will identify the three most relevant files. The main focus will be on the changes made to handle names ending with digits differently, which primarily affects the printing subsystem, particularly the conventions and pretty printing modules. Here are the files, ranked by their relevance:\n\n- `sympy/printing/conventions.py`: This file is directly mentioned in the test patch. It deals with the conventions used in printing, including handling of subscripts and superscripts. The modification made in the patch specifically addresses how names ending with digits are handled, making this file the most relevant to the issue and existing test patch.\n\nExplanation: The patch makes notable changes to how subscripts are detected and handled, particularly when they follow a Greek letter name. This adjustment in the printing convention is critical for ensuring that expressions are printed correctly according to the described issue.\n\n- `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py`: This file is also directly modified in the provided patch. It's responsible for the translation of symbol names to their \"pretty\" print versions, including handling Greek symbols, subscripts, superscripts, and other formatting tasks. Given that the issue pertains to printing names ending with digits in a specific manner, changes to this file directly impact the resolution of the issue.\n\nExplanation: Modifications in this file ensure that digits following Greek letters and other special cases are handled as expected, adhering to the newly defined conventions for subscript handling. This includes adjustments to ensure that certain substrings are translated or formatted correctly in the pretty print output.\n\n- `sympy/printing/tests/test_pretty.py`: While this specific file is not directly mentioned in the provided patch, it's highly relevant when considering test case additions or modifications to existing tests in response to the changes. Given that `pretty_symbology.py` is impacted by the patch, it's logical to inspect and potentially extend the test cases in `test_pretty.py` to cover the new behavior introduced by the changes.\n\nExplanation: Modifications affecting how expressions are pretty-printed would necessitate validation through corresponding test cases. This file likely contains tests around the pretty printing functionality and would be the appropriate place to add new tests or modify existing ones to ensure the changes behave as expected across various cases, especially handling of names with terminal digits.\n\nThese files collectively address the core of the issue described, touching upon the implementation of the formatting changes and ensuring that they are correctly tested within the SymPy printing subsystem.",
  "function_class_analysis": "Given the context of the provided patch and its focus on handling symbols, digits, and Greek letters in a special formatting context (specifically, dealing with subscripts and additions to pretty printing in Sympy), here are the top 3 functions/classes that should be prioritized for augmented test cases to resolve issues related to these changes:\n\n1. **sympy.printing.conventions.split_super_sub**\n   - This function undergoes significant changes to handle scenarios where variable names end with digits or are Greek letters followed by digits. The new logic introduced needs comprehensive testing to validate that the extraction of base names and subscripts works as intended across a wide range of inputs, including edge cases such as empty strings, strings with multiple digit groups, and strings that mix letters and digits in unusual ways. Given its foundational role in parsing variable names into components for pretty printing, ensuring robust test coverage here is crucial for preventing regressions or bugs in how symbols are displayed.\n\n2. **sympy.printing.pretty.pretty_symbology.pretty_symbol**\n   - Various enhancements have been made in this function to handle Greek letters, modifiers (like hat, tilde), numeric subscripts, and bold formatting. Given the diversity of modifications, augmented test cases should cover the integration of these changes with existing symbol handling, especially ensuring correct interactions between different types of modifications and the fallback mechanisms for unsupported character mappings. This function directly affects how symbols are rendered in pretty print, making it essential to validate through testing that symbols conform to expected mathematical notations after the patch.\n\n3. **sympy.printing.pretty.pretty_symbology.pretty_list**\n   - Although the adjustments in this function seem more minor in comparison, ensuring that the fallbacks to individual character mapping and the handling of subscript/superscript conversions work correctly is important. This function contributes to constructing the final pretty-printed strings by aggregating individual symbol parts into cohesive representations. Augmented tests should focus on cases where mappings might fail or partial mappings could result in unexpected outputs, impacting the readability and correctness of the printed mathematical expressions.\n\nEach of these functions plays a critical role in how symbols are parsed, handled, and ultimately displayed within Sympy's pretty printing capabilities. Given the patch's emphasis on enhancing the formatting logic to accommodate more complex variable names\u2014including those with digits and Greek letters\u2014ensuring comprehensive test coverage will help maintain the library's quality and reliability for its user base.",
  "line_level_analysis": "Based on the provided code segments and focusing on areas with conditional logic, error handling, and data validation, while also including 10 lines of surrounding context, here are the identified ranges for test insertion:\n\n1. **For** `split_super_sub` **function in** `sympy/printing/conventions.py`:\n    - Handling names that end with digits or containing Greek letters with digits.\n        ```python\n        # This includes conditional logic on handling different name formats\n        split_super_sub: 52-73\n        ```\n        This range (62-73, with 10 lines of context added) covers the newly added logic to handle names ending with digits differently if they are Greek letters, including the logic to segregate base name parts from digit parts and the regular expression matching for non-Greek names.\n\n2. **For** `pretty_symbol` **function in** `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py`:\n    - Modifying the translation of a symbol name, including processing of Greek letters, modifiers, and conversion to subscript.\n        ```python\n        # This area evolves around translating symbols, adding checks for Greek letters, and handling digit subscripts\n        pretty_symbol: 508-541\n        ```\n        The specified range (518-541, with 10 lines of surrounding context) takes into account the modifications to how symbols are translated, especially the new logic to check for Greek letters, modifiers, and how digits are handled.\n\n3. **Further within** `pretty_symbol`, **addressing subscript and superscript pretty formatting**:\n    - Bringing improvements and validations for subscript/superscript formatting.\n        ```python\n        # This zone involves error handling and data validation for superscripts and subscripts formatting.\n        pretty_symbol: 548-581\n        ```\n        In this section (538-571, with 10 lines of context), the focus is on the logic for dealing with the lists of superscripts and subscripts, including error handling for type and key errors, and the detailed manipulation for pretty printing these components.\n\n4. **Also in** `pretty_symbol`, **handling the assembly of name with subscript/superscript**:\n    - Combining main symbol names with their subscripts and superscripts using improved logic.\n        ```python\n        # This segment involves final assembly of name with its subscripts and superscripts, offering a mixed bag of conditional checks and string manipulation.\n        pretty_symbol: 563-597\n        ```\n        The final part (554-571, extended to include more context) showcases a change in how subscripts are attached to the main symbol names. It employs a nuanced approach of checking if each character can be subscripted, with a fallback for non-matching cases, and demonstrates conditional logic to handle diverse cases effectively.\n\nThese identified ranges provide a comprehensive look into where significant logical changes have occurred, incorporating areas ripe for testing based on the given output requirements.",
